# data_vis-immigrants

'''
This is a data visualization project I did last summer during a program at UChicago. 
We were given some data on wave heights in the Mediterranean, riots in Northern Africa, and immigrant arrivals in Europe. 
Our goal was to predict how our variables effect immigrant arrivals. 
I ran some regression tests to see the significance of our model, and then built a visual model of the data.
Please read the markdown to get a more in depth explantion of what is going on. You can also look at the powerpoint I made,
and the policy recommendation.
